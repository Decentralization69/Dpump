# 🚀 Community-Powered Token Launch Bot

Welcome to the **Community-Powered Token Launch Bot**! In the fast-paced world of blockchain, **community involvement is everything**. Why let a single developer dictate which tokens hit the market? With our innovative Twitter bot, **@DPUMPDEPLOY**, **you** hold the power! 🌟

## 🌟 Overview

This is your chance to shape the future of token creation. Propose a token with just a tweet, and watch as the community decides which ideas come to life. It's time to put the **power back in the hands of the people**!

## 🔥 How It Works

### Step 1: Launch a Token
Ready to make your mark? Simply tweet to **@DPUMPDEPLOY** using this format:

Add an eye-catching image to grab attention! ALL THESE ARE MUST!

### Step 2: Community Voting
Once your tweet is live, the clock starts ticking! The community has **10 minutes** to like your proposal. The more engagement, the better!

### Step 3: Token Creation
At the end of the voting period, the tweet with the **most likes** wins! The bot automatically launches the token, all thanks to community choice. **It’s that simple!**
